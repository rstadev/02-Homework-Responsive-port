        <p>I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!
